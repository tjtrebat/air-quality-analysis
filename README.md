CSCE5310 Air Quality Analysis Hypothesis Tests and Regression Tasks
#
I have selected Temperature variable and compared it with other variables, pressure, wind, and humididty coloumns from the dataset to analyze
#
After that I have selected 100 random samples rows to work with.
#
stored the temperature and other comparing variables data into x and y arrays.
#
split the data into training and testing sets to fit and evaluate the model.
#
fit a linear regression model to make the predictions on test data.
#
calculation for mean squared error is done, target value to predicted value. x as feature vector and y as response vector.
#
visualized regression line for test data
#
plotting the residuals plots.
